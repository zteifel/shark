In the field of complex systems animals and evolution are commonly mentioned and to get a proper idea of evolution between a predator and its prey, one need to model both parts and see how the adapt to one another. The task of this project is to determine if it is possible to model a shark hunting and catching fish from a fish shoal that uses an existing swarming and predator avoidance algorithm. The idea is to set rules for the shark and train an artificial neural network using a genetic optimization algorithm using the rules and input and basic movements for the shark as output. The results were promising proving that indeed it is possible to make such a model, however it could not outperform a simple programmed AI doing the same task.
