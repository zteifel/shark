In this section, how our model works and the approach we have
used will be explained. First an explaination of the interactions between the
shark and fish, then a more in depth description of how the fish
and shark models work.\\
\\
The fish model used is a combination of previously used models with
modifications to it developed for the project. The model of the
shark is based on multi layer feed forward artificial neural network, trained
using an evolutionary algorithm.\\
\\
Since the only matter of interest in this model is the shark when
it is hunting, the model is limited to only include the phase where the
shark has visual contact with the fish shoal. This gives the advantage that the
evaluation can be stopped in training of sharks that go to far away from the
fish. Let us consider an infinite large sea where the fish are free to move
around in the sea without any boundary or periodic boundary. This gives a large
performance gain in the training of the neural network while remaining
closer to the biological foundation since there is no need to consider a
``wrap-around'' calculation, and there is no ``fish tank'' phenomena.\\
\\
The movement of the fish and shark is not constrained by any structure or grid.
It can however only have discrete coordinates. It is also limited by the model
of the shark itself as will be explained below.\\
\\
The shark and fish shoal positions are updated asynchronously, but the fish in
the shoal is updated synchronously. If the shark moves to the position of a
fish, the fish is considered eaten by the shark and is as a result removed from
the shoal.\\
\\
To compare if the shark we acquire from the evolutionary based training is
successfull, we compare it to a shark that uses a more straight forward
``classical AI'' approach where the AI is programmed.\\
\\
Now we will proceed to the more detailed descriptions of the fish and shark
models.

\subsection{The fish shoal}

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:swarm} Fish shoal model.}
\end{figure}

The swarming model used is based on the two models found in the references
\cite{javafish} and \cite{matlabfish}. It follows the same rules as the basic
swarming model, namely repulsion, alignment and attraction. Each of these rules
applies at a certain distance range from the fish which can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:swarm}. If another fish enters the zone of repulsion they will tend to
repel each other and not surprisingly if they are within the attraction
distance, they will tend to move towards each other. In the zone of alignment
they tend to align themselves so that they will move in the same direction as
the other fish in that zone. Behind the fish there is also a dead zone where no
interaction occur (most animals can not see things behind themselves). To
further improve the behavior of the swarm, there is also an addition to the
algorithm called distance priority \cite{matlabfish}. It makes the fish tend to
align itself to the average direction of a set number of its closest neighbors,
regardless of which zone they are in.\\
\\
The fish in the shoal move at a constant drift speed but can accelerate to a max
speed to avoid the shark. The way the fish in this model avoids the shark is
quite simple. A scare distance is set for the fish and should the predator be
within this distance, the fish will completely ignore the swarming rules and
update the velocity according to
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_f \rightarrow \vec{v}_f - (\vec{x}_s - \vec{x}_f)a
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v}_f$ is the velocity of the fish, $\vec{x}_s$ the position of the
shark, $\vec{x}_f$ the position of the fish and $a$ is a constant called
acceleration rate, which decides how fast the fish will be able to reach its max
speed (note that the time step is excluded since it will always be set to 1). In
other words the fish will just move in opposite direction of where the shark is
relative to itself starting at its drift speed and accelerating to its max
speed. Having the avoidance rule this way makes for a problem however since this
could force a fish to move outside of the attraction zone of the fish furthest
out in the shoal. To solve this it is added that should a fish get too far away
from the center of the shoal (average position of all fish), it will move
strictly towards this point if not too close to the shark.

\subsection{The shark}

The model is inspired by nature, but is not an exact description of how sharks
behave.

The shark has many senses it can use to detect prey, even on large distances
using sight, smell, hearing, electro reception and by detecting vibrations in
water\cite{shark_vision}\cite{shark_electric}. Since the model is limited
to the actual fish catching phase of the hunting there is no interest in the
long distance senses. It is unknown exactly how the all the sharks senses work and
it is therefore difficult to model them. For the model an approach was chosen
that symbolizes a combination of the senses in a single sensory input.\\
\\
The sense model is also limited by the kind of input that are usable with the
neural network. The model allows the shark to perceive a fish shoal in front
and back of the shark separately as well as the closest fish in the area where
the shark is able to catch the fish.\\
\\
Even though the shark is a very agile predator it can not turn in full speed on
the spot, therefore the shark's turning angle is constrained so that it can
only turn $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radians in each time step. This means that a shark
moving at greater speeds will need a larger area for turning.\\
\\
The parameters of the shark are:
\begin{itemize}
\item observe distance
\item max step size
\item energy reserve
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The brain -- artificial neural network}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figs/ann_structure.png}
\caption{\label{fig:ann}}
\end{figure}

The shark's behavior is controlled by an artificial neural network, ANN. The
inputs to the network, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ann}, is the center of
the fish shoal in front and back as well as the position of the closest fish
within the shark's attack area (the sector in front of the shark with angle
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ up to the shark's maximum movement distance). The positions are
given to the network in polar coordinates relative to the shark's position and
direction, normalized between zero and unity. The distances are 0 when the
position is at the furthest position and 1 at the same position as the shark.
The angles are 0 when on the right edge of the sector and 1 when on the left
edge of the sector. When in front of the shark the angle is 0.5.\\
\\
The output from the network is also given in normalized polar coordinates
relative to the shark where step size 1 means maximum step size. The direction
is normalized in the same way as the input.\\
\\
The network consist of the 6 input neurons explained above, 3 hidden layers with
one neuron less than the previous layers and 2 output neurons also explained
above. In addition to this, each layer (except for the output layer) has an
extra neuron with input constant 1. This extra neuron acts as the threshold.\\
\\
The network was trained using an evolutionary genetic algorithm with real
number encoding, crossover, mutation and elite inserts starting from a random
population.\\
\\
In each generation of the training, each individual is given a fitness value
based on an evaluation where the sharks is hunting fish as described earlier.\\
\\
Since the shark is a predator and as such its success in hunting can be measured
by the amount of energy spent on the hunt in regards to how much energy it could
consume from the prey caught. The fitness is calculated as follows for each
individual:

\begin{equation}
  F = S+D\label{eq:fitness}
\end{equation}

Where $S$ is the number of fish caught by the shark and $D$ is the average
distance to the center of the closest fish shoal normalized between zero and
unity. The distance is part of the fitness calculation to remove the
discreteness. This helps to differentiate between individuals that caught the
same amount of fish, especially in the beginning of the training where no fish
are caught.\\
\\
The fitness value itself does not contain any information about how much energy
it spent catching its prey, instead this is handled by the stop condition that
the shark only has a certain amount of energy to spend before the evaluation is
stopped. The evaluation can also be stopped if the shark loses contact with the
fish. The energy is calculated as distance moved. Therefore a shark that turns
in a greater speed consumes more energy than a shark that turns in slower speed,
due to that the faster moving shark needs a larger area to turn on.

\subsection{Shark for comparison}
The fitness value of the shark is great to compare different ANN-sharks, but how
can it be determined if the shark with the best fitness value is good, decent or
bad? A visual representation of the shark hunting can be analyzed, and from
this its behavior can be evaluated. Another approach that is a bit less
heuristic is to compare it with a hard coded algorithm instead of the ANN.
The inputs and outputs to this algorithm we came up with is the same as to the
ANN. The algorithm can be described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the distance to the closest fish is not zero (fish in attack area):\\
    \hspace*{5pt}Eat that fish.
\item Else if fish shoal in front of shark and within move angle: \\
    \hspace*{5pt}Let output be the polar coordinates to the fish shoal in front.
\item Else if fish shoal in front of shark and not within move angle: \\
    \hspace*{5pt}Move with maximum angle toward the fish shoal with 20\% of max speed.
\item Else if fish shoal in back:\\
    \hspace*{5pt}Move with maximum angle to the side that is closes to the fish
    shoal with 20\% of max speed.
\end{enumerate}
